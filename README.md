Days 39-40 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 39: Grand Central Dispatch, quality of service queues, performSelector(), async(), and using performSelector(inBackground:).

## Challenges

Day 40:

It was all about modifying previous projects. To see how it went, check out those projects in my repositories!

1. Modify project 1 so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!
2. Modify project 8 so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
3. Modify project 7 so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!
